Service may be taken for a shorter period subject to the provisions of the short-term service charge.\r\nSHORT-TERM SERVICE CHARGE\r\nCustomers who take short-term service will be billed for the first three months, or fraction thereof, $28.23 per month in addition to the regular monthly electric service rate (including the monthly minimum charge). A customer will be billed for no fewer than three consecutive months of short-term service.\r\nA credit equal to one-ninth of the amount of short-term service charges billed during the first three months of short-term service will be applied to a short-term customer's bill for each month, or fraction thereof, that the short-term customer's term of service exceeds three months. In no case will the total amount of such credits exceed the total amount of short-term service charges billed.\r\nWhen seasonal service customers take service for less than twelve consecutive months, they will be considered to be short-term customers and their final bills will be adjusted to include any unbilled short-term service charges and credits.",

However, if the wiring is so arranged that the service for residential purposes can be metered separately, this Rate will be applied to the residential service, if the service qualifies hereunder.",
